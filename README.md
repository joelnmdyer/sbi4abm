# sbi4abm: simulation-based inference for agent-based modelling

Calibrating agent-based model (ABM) parameters is a challenging task: ABMs are expensive, stochastic, dynamical models that can generate complex, non-equilibrium, and high-dimensional time-series data as output. Furthermore, ABMs typically do not have tractable likelihood functions. Procedures for _simulation-based inference_ are indispensable in this setting, but many of these are not well-suited to ABMs, often requiring many hundreds of thousands of calls to the simulator and/or inappropriate assumptions on the form of the data generated by the ABM. This limits their applicability to arbitrary ABMs.

In this repository, we provide code that builds on the [`sbi` package](https://github.com/mackelab/sbi) to allow agent-based modellers to perform **black-box Bayesian estimation** of an ABM's parameters using powerful simulation-based inference procedures based on neural networks. These procedures -- known as neural posterior estimation (`NPE`) and neural density ratio estimation (`NRE`) -- have been seen to generate remarkably accurate parameter posteriors, capturing the uncertainty in parameter estimates using orders of magnitude fewer simulation runs than more conventional inference methods. Recent research (see **Papers** section below) has shown that such approaches are highly-suited to ABM estimation problems and can flexibly and automatically handle high-dimensional and non-linear data of various types that would arise in ABM settings, without the need to impose inappropriate assumptions on the form of the ABM or on the data it generates.

This package makes use of the [`sbi` package](https://github.com/mackelab/sbi), and citation info on the relevant papers can be found in the documentation for this package. I changed a few lines in the source code for `sbi` to allow $z$-scoring of data to be specified as a boolean argument for `SNPE` and `SNRE`, and I've included the modified package in this repository for that reason.

## Example usage
If you want to get a parameter posterior out for the Hopfield model using a recurrent graph neural network and masked autoregressive flow with a budget of 1000 simulations from the ABM to train the density estimator, you can navigate to the `sbi4abm/utils` folder and run
```
python job_script.py --task hop --method maf_rgcn --outloc <location_to_save_output> --nsims 1000
```

## Applying these methods to a new model
Applying these methods to a new model not contained in this respository can be done like so:
* Add the model to the `models` folder, wrapping the model up in the same format as in the examples contained in that folder
* Add details on the prior density, model instantiation, and "true" data in the `utils/io.py` file
* Ensure the density (ratio) estimator is equipped with an appropriate embedding network in the `utils/job_script.py` and `inference/neural.py` files
* Training the density (ratio) estimator using the same command as in the **Example usage** section above
